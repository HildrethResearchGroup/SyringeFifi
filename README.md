# Connection Instructions

In order to set up the connection to your syringe pumps, follow the instructions below.

## Required Equipment

To complete this setup, you will need the following equipment:
- 2 NE-501 syringe pumps and power cables
- RS232 to Ethernet adapter (we used PUSR USR-TCP232-302) and power cable
- USB Ethernet adapter
- Ethernet cable
- Null modem adapter
- 1 RS-232 pump network cable (must use cable that comes with pump)
- 1 RJ11 cable (must use cable that comes with pump)

## Setup

1. **Powering the Pumps**:
   - Connect each NE-501 syringe pump to its power cable, plug them into a power outlet and flip the back power switch.
2. **Connecting the Pumps**:
   - Use the RS-232 pump network cable to connect the first pump to the RS232 to Ethernet converter with the null modem converter.
   - Connect the RS232 to ethernet adapter to power source.
   - Connect to RS232 to ethernet adapter to USB ethernet adapter using ethernet cable in LAN port.
   - Connect the USB ethernet adapter to computer USB port.
   - Use the phone line style cable to connect the second pump to the first pump. This creates a network between the two pumps. Cable should go in "to network" port of first pump and "to computer" port of second pump.

3. **Setting Up the RS232 to Ethernet Converter**:
